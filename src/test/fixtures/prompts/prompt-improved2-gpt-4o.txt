Certainly! Below, I have broken the process into detailed steps as you requested.

---

### **<Step_1> Preliminary Review**
#### **Analysis of the Original Prompt:**
- **Goal:** Generate a CSV file containing 5 ranked translations that best reflect the source phrase using only phrases from a given translated passage.
- **Inputs:** A source phrase, the translation of a passage, and translation data with scores.
- **Outputs:** A ranked CSV file with two columns: "translation" and "rank."
- **Features of the provided prompt:**
  - Clearly indicates a need for AI interpretation to extract high-quality matches.
  - Asks for rankings based on similarity (likely via calculated match scores) while ensuring the output is constrained to the provided translation.

#### **Weaknesses in the Original Prompt:**
1. **Fragmentation of Concepts:** The prompt breaks instructions across multiple sentences but doesn't organize them into a unified goal or framework. The reader may get confused between different pieces of information (e.g., translation constraints, ranking rules, etc.).
2. **Lack of Clarity:** The scoring mechanism, expected behavior when scores are equal, and nuances of how phrases should be detected (only contiguous phrases or combinations?) are not adequately specified.
3. **Verbosity:** Some information can be stated more concisely while retaining meaning.
4. **Generality:** The prompt doesn't define whether the score solely determines ranking or if other linguistic factors (e.g., contextual accuracy) are also involved.

#### **Conceptual Goals:**
The core of concept elevation requires distilling the goals into three main pillars:
1. **Action:** Precisely define what the AI is tasked with (highlighting phrases and producing a CSV).
2. **Input Handling:** Clearly specify the three inputs (source phrase, translated passage, and scoring data) and how they interact.
3. **Output Specification:** Ensure the format, method of ranking, and constraints are explicit for the AI to follow easily.

</Step_1>

### **<Step_2> Organizing Key Concepts**
#### **Identified Key Groups Based on Concept Elevation**
1. **Core Task Definition:**
   - Highlight phrases from the provided translation that best reflect the meaning of the source phrase.
   - Limit selection to a maximum of 5 phrases, ranked by score-based relevance.
2. **Input Description:**
   - **Source Phrase:** Guide for identifying relevant content.
   - **Translated Passage:** Strict boundary for the output; selected phrases can only consist of words/phrases in this translation.
   - **Translation Data:** Source-to-translation matches and scores for calculating relevance.
3. **Output Requirements:**
   - Produce a CSV file with two columns: "translation" and "rank."
   - Ensure the order corresponds to descending relevance (highest-ranked first).
   - Maintain a strict cap of 5 phrase entries.
4. **Methodology and Ranking Strategy:**
   - How to generate and rank phrases:
     - Score-based ranking: Sum scores of the words in each phrase.
     - Phrase constraints: Phrases may contain one or more contiguous or non-contiguous words, but must only include those in the translated passage.
   - Handle ties by ordering based on appearance in the translated passage (earlier phrases take precedence).

**Output of this step:**
Each group highlights a clearer, higher-level abstraction of the instructions for simplicity and adaptability.

### **<Step_3> Developing the Improved Prompt**
#### **Candidate Prompt:**
Here is the first draft of a more concise and concept-elevated version:

<prompt_candidate>
Given the following inputs:
1. A **source phrase** as the reference: `τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν`
2. A **translated passage**: `আর তোমরা তোমাদের অপরাধে ও পাপে মৃত ছিলে`
3. A **dataset of word-to-word translations and scores** (see below):

```
score,translatedText,sourceText
100.0041,তোমাদের,τοῖς
100.0013,তোমরা,τοῖς
...
```


Your task is to identify **up to 5 phrases**, ranked by relevance, from the translated passage that best reflect the meaning of the source phrase, using only words and phrases present in the translated passage. Follow these steps:

1. Use the dataset to evaluate relevance:
   - Match translated words in the passage to their **source equivalents** using the dataset.
   - Sum the scores of individual words within each candidate phrase to calculate its relevance.
2. Rank the phrases:
   - Start with the phrase that has the **highest summed score**.
   - If two phrases have equal scores, choose the one that appears earlier in the translated passage.
   - Ensure uniqueness (select different phrases for each rank).
3. Output the result:
   - Format the response as a CSV file with two columns: "translation" (phrase) and "rank" (1-5).
   - Ensure no more than 5 phrases are returned.

</prompt_candidate>

</Step_3>

### **<Step_4> Refinement and Finalization**
#### **Critical Review:**
- **Strengths:**
  - The candidate prompt is more concise, grouping core tasks and clarifying actions within a logical sequence.
  - Describes scoring, ranking, and constraints with sufficient specificity for predictable and accurate AI behavior.
- **Room for Improvement:**
  - Might benefit from explicitly defining whether phrases can include non-contiguous words from the passage.

#### **Final Adjustments:**
Added a note about whether phrases need to be contiguous and ensured even word order is well-defined.

<prompt_final>
You are tasked with identifying the **top 5 phrases** from a translated passage that best reflect the meaning of a provided source phrase. Follow these steps carefully:

### **Inputs:**
1. **Source Phrase:** `τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν`
2. **Translated Passage:** `আর তোমরা তোমাদের অপরাধে ও পাপে মৃত ছিলে`
3. **Translation Data:** A CSV file containing word-to-word mapping between the source and translation, along with scores (example below):

```
score,translatedText,sourceText
100.0041,তোমাদের,τοῖς
100.0013,তোমরা,τοῖς
...
```


### **Task:**
1. Identify **up to 5 phrases** from the translated passage that best reflect the source phrase.
   - Each phrase can only include **words present in the translated passage**.
   - Phrases **must be contiguous**.
2. Rank the phrases by relevance:
   - Relevance is determined by the **summed scores of individual words** in each phrase, using the translation data.
   - In case of tied scores, prioritize by **earliest appearance** in the passage.
3. Return the results in CSV format:
   - Include two columns: "translation" (selected phrase) and "rank" (1-5).
   - Ensure the output contains no more than 5 entries.

### **Example:**
```
translation,rank
তোমাদের অপরাধে ও পাপে,1
তোমাদের পাপে ও অপরাধে,2
অপরাধে তোমাদের এবং পাপে,3
পাপে তোমাদের এবং অপরাধে,4
তোমাদের ও পাপে অপরাধে,5
```
